Coding Dojo Assignment

Assignment: Dojos & Ninjas with Template
Objectives:
Practice incorporating a one-to-many relationship in a full-stack application
Using the same project from the previous assignment, add a template and the necessary routes to perform these actions:



 Add a template to your app
 Add a route that renders this template and have it display a list of all the dojos and their associated ninjas
 Add a route to process the creation of a new dojo
 Add a route to process the creation of a new ninja; the dropdown on the form should be a list of all existing dojos
 NINJA BONUS: Add a delete button next to each dojo name that deletes that dojo (and all associated ninjas) from the database
 SENSEI BONUS: Add a count of ninjas next to each dojo name (eg. Ninjas at the Painting Dojo - 2; Ninjas at the Architecture Dojo - 0)
